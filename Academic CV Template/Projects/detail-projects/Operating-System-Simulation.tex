  % \item Applied [specific method] to analyze [specific aspect]
  % \item \justifying{Collaborated with others to develop a simulation of a simple Operating System (OS) by implementing asynchronous \& synchronous theories.}
  \item \justifying{Designed and implemented the scheduler with \textbf{Multi-Level Queue} (MLQ) policy used in Linux kernel.}
  \item \justifying{Designed and simulated the \textbf{memory mapping} between CPU and RAM for each process}
  \item \justifying{Demonstrated the \textbf{physical memory} in virtual and implemented the \textbf{swapping} mechanism}
  \item \justifying{Implemented the \textbf{paging-based address translation} in a single-level paging system}
  % \item \justifying{Designed, and simulated major components in a simple operating system: \textbf{scheduler}, \textbf{synchronization}, related operations of \textbf{physical memory} and \textbf{virtual memory}}
  \item \justifying{Leveraged \textbf{ANSI C} libraries in combination with \textbf{POXIS standards} to build the simulation. }
  \item \justifying{Automated the build process using \textbf{Makefile} for efficient project compilation and management}
