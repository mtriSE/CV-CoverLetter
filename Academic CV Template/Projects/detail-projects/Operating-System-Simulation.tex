  % \item Developed [specific feature/system] for [specific purpose]
  % \item Implemented [specific technology] for [specific goal], achieving [specific result]
  % \item Created [specific component], ensuring [specific benefit]
  % \item Applied [specific method] to analyze [specific aspect]
  \item \justifying{Collaborated with others to develop a simulation of a simple Operating System (OS) by implementing asynchronous \& synchronous theories.}
  \item \justifying{Designed, and simulated major components in a simple operating system: \textbf{scheduler}, \textbf{synchronization}, related operations of \textbf{physical memory} and \textbf{virtual memory}}
  \item \justifying{Used GNU/Linux libraries in combination with \textbf{POXIS standards} to build the simulation. Besides that, we also use \textbf{Makefile} for controlling and building the source code more effectively.}
